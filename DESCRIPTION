Description: The aim of dasper is to detect aberrant splicing events 
  from RNA-seq data. By comparing patient RNA-seq data to a set of user-defined 
  controls, dasper will score each splicing event in the patient with an anomaly 
  score representing the degree to which that splicing event looks abnormal.
