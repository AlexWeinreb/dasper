# Basics

## Install `dasper`

`R` is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages. `r Biocpkg("dasper")` is a `R` package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) repository for packages. `R` can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install `r Biocpkg("dasper")` by using the following commands in your `R` session:

```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("dasper")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```

## Required knowledge

The expected input of `r Biocpkg("dasper")` are junctions reads (outputted from an aligner such as [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)) and coverage in the form of BigWig files (which can be generated from BAM files using [RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/#bam2wig-py).`r Biocpkg("dasper")` is based on many other packages and in particular in those that have implemented the infrastructure needed for dealing with RNA-seq data. The packages `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` and `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")` are used throughout, therefore familiarity with these packages will greatly help in interpreting the output of `r Biocpkg("dasper")`. 

If you are asking yourself the question "Where do I start using Bioconductor?" you might be interested in [this blog post](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/10/16/startbioc/#.VkOKbq6rRuU).

## Asking for help

As package developers, we try to explain clearly how to use our packages and in which order to use the functions. But `R` and `Bioconductor` have a steep learning curve so it is critical to learn where to ask for help. The blog post quoted above mentions some but we would like to highlight the [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org/) as the main resource for getting help: remember to use the `dasper` tag and check [the older posts](https://support.bioconductor.org/t/dasper/). Other alternatives are available such as creating GitHub issues and tweeting. However, please note that if you want to receive help you should adhere to the [posting guidelines](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/). It is particularly critical that you provide a small reproducible example and your session information so package developers can track down the source of the error.

## Citing `dasper`

We hope that `r Biocpkg("dasper")` will be useful for your research. Please use the following information to cite the package and the overall approach. Thank you!

```{r "citation"}
## Citation info
citation("dasper")
```

# Quick start to using to `dasper`

## Workflow

```{r dasper workflow}
knitr::include_graphics("dasper_workflow.png")
```

The above workflow diagram gives a top-level overview of the core functions within `dasper` and describes the order in which they are intended to be run. This are broadly split into 4 categories: 

  1. **Process junctions** - these functions are prefixed with a "junction_". They will load in your junctions to an `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")`, annotate your junctions using reference annotation, filter out junctions for those that likely originate from techinical noise and normalise your junction counts to allow for comparison between samples. 
  2. **Process coverage** - these functions are prefixed with a "cov_". They annotate your junctions with coverage from nearby regions then normalise this coverage to allow for comparison between samples.
  3. **Outlier detection** - to be added. 
  4. **Sashimi plots** - to be added. 

## Example

```{r "start", message=FALSE}
library("dasper")
```

Edit this as you see fit =) (to be completed...)

Here is an example of you can cite your package inside the vignette:

* `r Biocpkg("dasper")` `r citep(bib[["dasper"]])`

# Reproducibility

The `r Biocpkg("dasper")` package `r citep(bib[["dasper"]])` was made possible thanks to:

* R `r citep(bib[["R"]])`
* `r Biocpkg("BiocStyle")` `r citep(bib[["BiocStyle"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("knitcitations")` `r citep(bib[["knitcitations"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("knitr")` `r citep(bib[["knitr"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("rmarkdown")` `r citep(bib[["rmarkdown"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("sessioninfo")` `r citep(bib[["sessioninfo"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("testthat")` `r citep(bib[["testthat"]])`

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Githubpkg("lcolladotor/biocthis")`.

Code for creating the vignette

```{r createVignette, eval=FALSE}
## Create the vignette
library("rmarkdown")
system.time(render("dasper.Rmd", "BiocStyle::html_document"))

## Extract the R code
library("knitr")
knit("dasper.Rmd", tangle = TRUE)
```

```{r createVignette2}
## Clean up
file.remove("dasper.bib")
```

Date the vignette was generated.

```{r reproduce1, echo=FALSE}
## Date the vignette was generated
Sys.time()
```

Wallclock time spent generating the vignette.

```{r reproduce2, echo=FALSE}
## Processing time in seconds
totalTime <- diff(c(startTime, Sys.time()))
round(totalTime, digits = 3)
```

`R` session information.

```{r reproduce3, echo=FALSE}
## Session info
library("sessioninfo")
options(width = 120)
session_info()
```

# Bibliography

This vignette was generated using `r Biocpkg("BiocStyle")` `r citep(bib[["BiocStyle"]])`
with `r CRANpkg("knitr")` `r citep(bib[["knitr"]])` and `r CRANpkg("rmarkdown")` `r citep(bib[["rmarkdown"]])` running behind the scenes.

Citations made with `r CRANpkg("knitcitations")` `r citep(bib[["knitcitations"]])`.
